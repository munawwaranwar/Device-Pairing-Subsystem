## Frontend Application Repo
https://github.com/dirbs/Device-Pairing-Subsystem-Frontend

## Directory structure
This repository contains code for **DPS** part of the **DIRBS**. It contains
* ``app/`` -- The DPS core server app, to be used as DPS Web Server including database models, apis and resources
* ``mock/`` -- Sample data files etc which are used in app to be reside here
* ``scripts/`` -- Pair-Deletion script, pair-list generation script etc
* ``tests/`` -- Unit test scripts and Data
* ``Documentation/`` -- Installation guide for DPS

## Prerequisites
In order to run a development environment, [Python 3.0+](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and
[Postgresql10](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1786/) are assumed to be already installed.

We also assume that this repo is cloned from Github onto the local computer, it is assumed that
all commands mentioned in this guide are run from root directory of the project and inside
```virtual environment```

On Windows, we assume that a Bash like shell is available (i.e Bash under Cygwin), with GNU make installed.

## Starting a dev environment
The easiest and quickest way to get started is to use local-only environment (i.e everything runs locally, including
Postgresql Server). To setup the local environment, follow the section below:

## Setting up local dev environment
For setting up a local dev environment we assume that the ```prerequisites``` are met already. To setup a local
environment:
* Create database using Postgresql (Name and credentials should be same as in [config](mock/test-config.ini))
* Create virtual environment using **virtualenv** and activate it:
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Make sure that virtual-env is made using Python3 and all the required dependencies are installed.
* Run Database migrations using:
```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
python manage.py create_view
```
This will automatically create and migrate database schemas and requirements.

* Start DPS development server using:
```bash
python run.py
```
This will start a flask development environment for DPS.

* To run unit tests, run:
```bash
pytest -v -s
```

## Other Helpful Commands


To Upgrade already installed database:
```bash
python manage.py db upgrade
```

To generate full pairing-list for DIRBS Core:
```bash
python scripts/pairlist_gen_complete.py
```

To generate delta pairing-list for DIRBS Core:
```bash
python scripts/pairlist_gen_delta.py
```

To delete un-confirmed pairs to clean-up main DB:
```bash
python scripts/unconfirmed_pair_deletion.py
```

To run unit and regression tests:
```bash
pytest -v -s
```

To enable different languages & activate their translations from English
```bash
pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k _l -o messages.pot .
pybabel init -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l <language-code>
```
e.g to translate in Spanish 
```bash
pybabel init -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l es
```
Finally to compile the language
```bash
pybabel compile -d app/translations
```
To update any translation after compilation
```bash
pybabel update -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l es
```
